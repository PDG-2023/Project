# StoreMe
Welcome to `StoreMe&nbsp;©`, the simple and efficient inventory management solution for businesses of all sizes. Our platform is designed to help you easily manage your inventory by focusing on three key concepts: categories of items, locations of items, and the items themselves.

With `StoreMe&nbsp;©`, you can easily organize your inventory by assigning categories to each item. Whether you're managing clothing, electronics, or office supplies, our platform allows you to categorize your items in a way that makes sense for your business.

In addition, our location tracking feature enables you to keep track of where each item is stored. This helps you quickly locate items when you need them and also makes it easy to keep track of inventory levels for each location.

Finally, `StoreMe&nbsp;©` allows you to track each individual item in your inventory, giving you a complete picture of your stock levels and enabling you to easily manage restocking and ordering.

Making your workflow as simple as possible is the #1 priority, therefore we allow scanning of barcodes as well as 2D codes (such as QR codes).

With its simple and intuitive design, `StoreMe&nbsp;©` makes it easy to manage your inventory and stay on top of your stock levels. Say goodbye to the hassle of manual inventory management and streamline your operations with `StoreMe&nbsp;©`. Sign up today and take control of your inventory!
